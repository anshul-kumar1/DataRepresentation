Question 3:
Binary number = 01011001011001010111001100100001

a) Unsinged Binary number:
    (2^0 * 1) + (2^1 * 0) + (2^2 * 0) + (2^3 * 0) + (2^4 * 0) + (2^5 * 1) + (2^6 * 0) + (2^7 * 0) + ... (2^31 * 1) + (2^32 * 0)
    = 1499820833

b) 2’s Complement binary number:
    Since the first number is 0, this means that it is a postive number and we do not need to change anything
    => 2’s Complement binary number of 01011001011001010111001100100001 = 1499820833

c) Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD):
    [0101] [1001] [0110] [0101] [0111] [0011] [0010] [0001]
    => 5 9 6 5 7 3 2 1 => 59657321
    Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) of 01011001011001010111001100100001 is 59657321

d) Biased 2^31:
    => 1499820833 (decimal form of 01011001011001010111001100100001) - 2^31
    => 1499820833 - 2147483648 = -647662815
